## About the PI
**Ronen Marmorstein, PhD**  
George W. Raiziss Professor  
Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics  
University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine

Our lab studies **epigenetics and chromatin regulation**, with a focus on 
protein acetylation, acetyl-CoA metabolism, and MAPK signaling pathways.  
We employ **structural biology** (X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM), biochemical 
assays, and **chemical biology** to elucidate molecular mechanisms and 
develop small-molecule probes.
